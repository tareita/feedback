# Trit Project

Trit is a chatbot that utilizes RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and FAISS (Fast Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search) to answer questions based on a collection of PDF documents. The main steps include:

1. Load all the PDF documents from a given directory using DirectoryLoader.
2. Append a separator (**\***) to the end of each documentâ€™s page content.
3. Split the documents into chunks of 3000 characters each using CharacterTextSplitter.
4. Embed the chunks into vectors using OpenAIEmbeddings and store them in a FAISS index using FAISS.from_documents.
5. Save the FAISS index locally using vectorstore.save_local.
6. Define a rag_chain that takes a question and a context as inputs and returns an answer using rag_prompt and llm.
7. Define a retriever that uses the FAISS index to find the most similar chunk to a given question using vectorstore.as_retriever.
8. Define a rag_chain_with_source that combines the retriever and the rag_chain to answer questions based on the PDF documents using RunnableParallel.
9. Define a chat function that takes a question as input and returns a JSON response with the question, the answer, and the context using rag_chain_with_source.invoke.
